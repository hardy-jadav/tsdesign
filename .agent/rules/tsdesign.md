Create a visually stunning, ultra-modern personal portfolio website using React JS with Vite as the build tool. The website should feel premium, futuristic, interactive, and immersive — similar to high-end developer portfolios and modern SaaS landing pages.

This website is for a Frontend / UI Developer with 2+ years of experience specializing in React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, and UI development.

🎨 DESIGN STYLE

Dark futuristic theme (deep black #0f0f0f or #0a0a0a)

Neon accent colors (electric blue / neon purple gradient)

Glassmorphism cards with backdrop blur

Subtle glowing borders

Smooth shadows and depth layers

Minimal but premium UI

Modern typography (Inter / Poppins style)

Clean spacing and grid layout

Fully responsive (mobile-first)

🖱️ 2. Custom Interactive Cursor

🧊 3. 3D / Depth Effects
